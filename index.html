				<h3>The medals win by women by year.</h3>
				<p>The rate of participation of women in the Olympics has been increasing since their first participation in 1948. Some sports are uniquely for women, others are contested by both sexes, while some older sports remain for men only. Studies of media coverage of the Olympics consistently show differences in the ways in which women and men are described and the ways in which their performances are discussed. </p>
